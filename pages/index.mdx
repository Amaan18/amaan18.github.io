# Amaan Gokak

Hey, I'm a 4th Year Computer Science Major at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. I enjoy working with all things software engineering/development (yes, they're the same thing, don't @ me)

Here you can find info about my work, personal projects, tech I work with, and blog posts, if I ever write any :D

Reach out to me on my email for any opportunities.
